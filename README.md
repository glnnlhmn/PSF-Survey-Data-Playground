# PSF Survey Data Playground

Welcome to the PSF Survey Data Playground! This repository, PSF-Survey-Data-Playground, contains data from the annual PSF survey. It is designed to be a comprehensive resource for data cleaning and exploration.

We encourage you to create your own notebooks and scripts to analyze and visualize the data. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced data scientist, this playground is the perfect place to experiment, learn, and share your insights.

Our goal is to foster a collaborative learning environment. By contributing your work, you help others understand different approaches and techniques. We believe in the power of community and the importance of sharing knowledge.

When you document your process, please aim to teach others. Explain your steps clearly and provide insights into your thought process. Even small contributions can make a big difference in helping others learn.

Remember, the primary goal of this project is to learn and grow together. So, dive in, experiment, and don't hesitate to share your findings. Let's make data science accessible and enjoyable for everyone!
